                    In 1984 Garip Ay was born in Siirt, Turkey. With his growing interest in pictorial arts since early
                    childhood, he has first admitted to Diyarbakır Fine Arts Highschool followed by a major in
                    Traditional
                    Turkish Arts in Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University. Throughout these years he started to focus on a
                    concept
                    which the art of Ebru is open for a change as the water it is made on. This concept was later
                    regarded
                    as a
                    step towards connecting a traditional Turkish art evolved into a brand new form.

                    Although his early work
                    was
                    consisting of portraits of Turkish names including Yunus Emre, Mimar Sinan, Piri Reis and more; he
                    was
                    recognized internationally with a remake of Starry Night by Van Gogh with a touch of Ebru. Followed
                    by
                    this
                    success Garip Ay was invited to many galleries around the world with his work including workshops
                    and
                    seminars. He introduced the renovated form of Ebru with help of video art as a medium and defended
                    the
                    idea
                    that the progress in Ebru was as crucial as the result and thrilling at the same time. Bearing these
                    progressions in mind, a new form of Ebru blended with digital arts had a chance to reach people all
                    around
                    the world.
